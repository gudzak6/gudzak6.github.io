                <p>On 9/15, I ran the Copenhagen half marathon and got a PR of 1:20:25. Check out the workout plan I used to get there! <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1adKXBAj2nYwSI00A2vDVrNg6GI9cBTyWK54vGcKij9k/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500 underline"></a></p>

            <img src="IMG_3170.JPEG" alt="Cookie Company" class="w-64 h-64 rounded-xl mr-4">
            <p> Over the past 4 years, I have vigoursely researched the science behind how a cookie is made. Sugar, flour, butter proportions all play a significant role in how each cookie is crafted. I've learned the differences between making a chewy, dense, thick, and flat cookies. I'm happy to share, I secretly have crafted the best recipe and am now taking orders! Email me for a batch!           </p>

        <p> If you know me, then you know 3 key things about me. 1. Cookies 2. Running. And 3, my enjoyment for exploring NYCs restaurant scene. With that, I somehow obtained a reservation at 4 Charles Prime Rib and had the best meal of my life. Pictured here is their burger with egg, thick cut bacon and three juicy patties.</p>
